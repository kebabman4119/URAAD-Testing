                The iCons Biodigester Team was founded in 2019 by a group of iCons students interested in anaerobic digestion
                technologies for improving campus sustainability. As iCons students, we have been impressed upon the need to 
                tackle society's grand challenges in renewable energy through collaboration and innovative thinking. Based 
                on preliminary research, we believed that anaerobic digestion provided a viable pathway with which to reduce 
                the UMass campus's carbon footprint and achieve its goal of 100% clean energy by 2030.

                    My name is Kieran Tay and I'm a rising Senior in Chemical Engineering. I love to rock climb, make music, 
                    and play guitar, but travelling is probably my favorite past time. In the UMass AD team, 
                    I'm heading the initiative for studying Anaerobic Digestion to gauge its feasibility and 
                    spread awareness about this sustainable energy source.

                    Hi! My name is Nick Sbalbi and I'm also a rising ChemE senior. In my free time I like to code, solve puzzles,
                    and create generative art (and post it on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nsbalbi">Twitter</a>).
                    On the AD team I'm leading the development of the economic calculator and created/maintain 
                    this website!

                    Hello! My name is Michael, and I'm a sophomore biology major. My favorite pastime is listening to music, and 
                    I also enjoy hiking and watching movies. On the AD team I help with planning and construction of the lab-scale 
                    digester, and hope to help manage it in the future when it is up and running.

                    Hello! My name is Florian Sabatini and I'm a Freshman in Mechanical Engineering. 
                    When I'm not in class I thoroughly enjoy paddleboarding, vinyl collecting, and watching a fair bit of anime.
                    As a part of the AD team I facilitate the construction and testing of prototype digesters.
